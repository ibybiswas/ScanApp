 *  - Fewer pages than cells: leftover cells are left blank (white), not an error.
 *  - More pages than cells: extra pages beyond the cell count are ignored.
 *    The picker UI should make this visually obvious rather than the
 *    compositor silently surprising the user, but the engine itself stays
 *    permissive so it never throws on a mismatched count.

 * Each page is scaled to FIT within its cell (preserving aspect ratio,
 * centered) rather than CROP — for documents, losing part of the page to a
 * crop is much worse than a bit of empty margin within the cell.
